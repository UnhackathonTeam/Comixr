Comxir is (or will be) a site where one can read all of their webcomics in one place.

To use Comixr:
Enter a url of the webcomic you wish to add to the page in the text box and click add.
Note: All urls must start with http://

Not all webcomics work with Comixr at the moment. We're currently in the process of fixing this.

Future functionalities:
Extended webcomic availability - allow more webcomics to work with Comixr
Remove Webcomic - remove a single webcomic
Improved input formatting - accept urls with or without "http://"
Categories/Tags - display webcomics with the same tag
Days of the week - display only the webcomics that update that day
Title/Alt-Text - dispaly the title and/or alt-text of the comic, if applicable
