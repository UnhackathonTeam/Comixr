idea for comixr:

on the topic of webscraping and legality in reagrd to authors not getting money, 
could we devise a system where everytime a page is accessed to get an image we
access that page in a way so that the author gets a page visit, meaning they
get ad revenue?

Users don't see there ads, our servers (or whatever would do it) pretends to be
a visitor to the site, giving them money.

We host our own ads in order to make our money.

Although, if people could do that I find it too easy to abuse.
